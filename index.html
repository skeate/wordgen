            <h2>Rule Specification</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Vowel=aeiou</dt>
                <dd>
                    Selector. In another rule, Vowel will be replaced by one of
                    a, e, i, o, or u. The names can be just about anything,
                    except for numbers (which have a special meaning, see
                    below).  Be careful with the names, though, as anything
                    matching will be assumed to be a reference.  For example,
                    if you make a rule a=q, any time you put a in another rule,
                    it will actually output q.
                </dd>
                <dt>ProbI=a25b30c45</dt>
                <dd>
                    Example of probabilistic selectors. Default base
                    probability is 100, so in this case a will be chosen 25%
                    of the time, b will be chosen 30% of the time, and c 45%
                    of the time.
                </dd>
                <dt>ProbII=c50</dt>
                <dd>
                    Another example.  This is incompletely specified, so ProbII
                    will be c half the time, and half the time it will be blank.
                <dt>ProbIII=a25bc</dt>
                <dd>
                    If there are unspecified choices, they split the remainder
                    of the probability. In this case, a has a 25% chance, while
                    b and c both have 37.5% (75%/2).
                </dd>
                <dt>ProbIV=12a2b3</dt>
                <dd>
                    Finally, you can change the default base probability by
                    putting a number right after the =. a will be chosen 2/12
                    times, b 3/12 times, and nothing the rest of the time.
                </dd>
                <dt>Syllable:ConsonantVowel</dt>
                <dd>
                    Merger. Syllable will be replaced by Consonant AND Vowel (in
                    that order).  For example, if Consonant=tpk and Vowel=aeiou,
                    some possible Syllables would be ta, po, ki.
                </dd>
                <dt>si~shi</dt>
                <dd>
                    Substitution.  If "si" shows up in any output, replace it
                    with "shi". Be careful with order, as they will be applied
                    sequentially.  If you have ty~ch and then hu~fu, tyu will
                    become cfu.
                </dd>
                <dt>&gt;Syllable{100,95,90,70,50,...}</dt>
                <dd>
                    Output.  In this case, it is based entirely on Syllable.
                    The numbers in the {braces} represent probability of
                    repetition. As above, there will always be at least one
                    Syllable.  Beyond that, there is a 95% chance of a second,
                    then a 90% chance of a third, 70% chance of a fourth, 50%
                    for a fifth. The (optional) ... indicates that the last
                    probability will repeat. The chance of repetition is
                    recalculated at every step, so there is, in this case, a
                    1*.95*.9*.7*.5 = 30% (approx) chance of a 5-syllable word.
