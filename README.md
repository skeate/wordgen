# wordgen

Should perhaps come up with a better name, but it is what it is for now. wordgen
is a word generator, useful (primarily?) for
[conlangers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)

It can be seen in action [here](http://lowpass.tk/generator).

## Build
To build wordgen (as it's mostly Coffeescript), run `make`. Afterward you should
have a "build" directory that will have the transpiled/minified code, ready for
hosting.
